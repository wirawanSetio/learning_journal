        "#### Allowing for Bias\n",
        "**Previously, we calculated the probability for each possible value of a random variable by simply dividing the number of combinations for that value by the total number of possible outcomes. This works if the probability of the event being tested is equal for failure and success**; but of course, not all experiments have an equal chance of success or failure. Some include a bias that makes success more or less likely - so we need to be a little more thorough in our calculations to allow for this.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you're flying off to some exotic destination, and you know that **there's a one in four chance that the airport security scanner will trigger a random search for each passenger that goes though.** If you watch five passengers go through the scanner, how many will be stopped for a random search?\n",
        "\n",
        "It's tempting to think that there's a one in four chance, so a quarter of the passengers will be stopped; but remember that the searches are triggered randomly for thousands of passengers that pass through the airport each day. *It's possible that none of the next five passengers will be searched; all five of them will be searched, or some other value in between will be searched.* \n",
        "\n",
        "Even though the probabilities of being searched or not searched are not the same, this is still a binomial variable. There are a fixed number of independent experiments (five passengers passing through the security scanner), the outcome of each experiment is either success (a search is triggered) or failure (no search is triggered), and the probability of being searched does not change for each passenger.\n",
        "\n",
        "**There are five experiments in which a passenger goes through the security scanner, let's call this `n`.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**For each passenger, the probability of being searched is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> or 0.25. We'll call this `p`.** \n",
        "\n",
        "The complement of **p** (in other words, the probability of *not* being searched) is **1-p**, in this case <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> or 0.75.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, **what's the probability that out of our `n` experiments, three result in a search (let's call that `k`) and the remaining ones (there will be `n-k` of them, which is two) don't?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The **probability of three passengers being searched** is 0.25 x 0.25 x 0.25 which is the same as 0.25<sup>3</sup>. Using our generic variables, this is **p<sup>k</sup>**.\n",
        "- The **probability that the rest don't get searched** is 0.75 x 0.75, or 0.75<sup>2</sup>. In terms of our variables, this is **1-p<sup>(n-k)</sup>**.\n",
        "- The **combined probability of three searchs and two non-searches** is therefore 0.25<sup>3</sup> x 0.75<sup>2</sup> (approximately 0.088). Using our variables, this is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\begin{equation}p^{k}(1-p)^{(n-k)}\\end{equation}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This formula enables us to calculate the probability for a single combination of `n` passengers in which `k` experiments had a successful outcome. In this case, it enables us to calculate that the probability of three passengers out of five being searched is approximately 0.088. However, we need to consider that there are multiple ways this can happen :\n",
        "* the first three passengers could get searched; or \n",
        "* the last three; or \n",
        "* the first, third, and fifth person, or \n",
        "* any other possible combination of 3 from 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two possible outcomes for each experiment; so the total number of possible combinations of five passengers being searched or not searched is 2<sup>5</sup> or 32. So within those 32 sets of possible result combinations, how many have three searches? We can use the <sub>n</sub>C<sub>k</sub> formula to calculate this:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\begin{equation}_{5}C_{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!} = \\frac{120}{6\\times 2} = \\frac{120}{24} = 5\\end{equation}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "So, **5 out of our 32 combinations had 3 searches and 2 non-searches**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "To find the **probability of any combination of 3 searches out of 5 passengers**, we need to multiply the number of possible combinations by the probability for a single combination - in this case <sup>5</sup>/<sub>32</sub> x 0.088, which is 0.01375, or 13.75%.\n",
        "\n",
        "So our complete formula to calculate the probabilty of ***k*** events from ***n*** experiments with probability ***p*** is:\n",

Another person observing 100 passengers may get a (very) different result from you. One way to address this problem is to take multiple samples and combine the resulting means to form a *sampling* distribution. This will help us ensure that the distribution and statistics of our sample data is closer to the true values; even if we can't measure the full population."

For example, we know that in a normal distribution, around 95.4% of the values are within two standard deviations of the mean. If we apply that to our sampling distribution of ten thousand 100-passenger samples, we can determine that the proportion of searched passengers in 95.4% of the samples was between 0.164 (16.4%) and 0.336 (36.6%).\n",
